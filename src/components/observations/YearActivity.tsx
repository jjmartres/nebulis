/**
 * A year of observing as twelve columns, which is also how you move around the
 * calendar.
 *
 * The month grid shows one month, and the chevrons beside its title gave no
 * clue whether the next one held anything. With nights spread over a couple of
 * years that meant clicking blind through empty months to find your own work.
 * Here the whole year is visible at once: bar height is nights out, the number
 * above it is the count, and clicking a column takes the calendar there. Empty
 * months stay in place, drawn as an empty slot rather than omitted, so the
 * spacing of a season reads honestly.
 *
 * Lives on the hero, so it is white-on-dark in every theme.
