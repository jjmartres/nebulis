/**
 * Scope (telescope) filtering for the Calibration Library.
 *
 * Calibration frames are stored per telescope under `_archive/<telescopeId>/`,
 * plus one shared `_archive/_unscoped/` bucket for runs that had no telescope
 * (a folder import). Every group the API returns already carries its `scope`, so
 * filtering is pure client-side work. This module owns the value mapping and the
 * `?scope=` round-trip so the page and its tests share one definition.
 *
 * `?scope=` carries a telescope id, the `UNSCOPED` sentinel, or nothing at all
 * for every scope. Telescope ids are UUIDs (server/lib/telescopes.ts), so they
 * are URL-safe as they stand.
