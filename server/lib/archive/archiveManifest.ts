/**
 * The archive's own record of what it put on the disk, and when.
 *
 * Retention cannot be written safely without this. "Delete anything older than N
 * days" applied to a directory listing would remove whatever the user happened to
 * leave in the archive folder, and there is no other way to answer the three
 * questions that matter:
 *
 *   - which objects did *we* create here,
 *   - when did we last touch each one, and
 *   - which of their files are subframes, so the subframes-only mode can be
 *     authoritative instead of re-deriving roles from filenames (the library
 *     knows a file's role from the import record; the archive disk does not).
 *
 * **The read path is fail-closed.** A missing, truncated, or unrecognisable
 * manifest reads as empty, and an empty manifest means retention has nothing to
 * remove. A damaged file on a removable disk therefore *disables* pruning rather
 * than licensing it, which is the failure direction that matters here.
 *
 * Mirrors the library's per-object manifest (`libraryFiles.ts`): a dot-prefixed
 * filename, so `isRealFile` rejects it everywhere and it can never be selected for
 * archiving back into itself.
