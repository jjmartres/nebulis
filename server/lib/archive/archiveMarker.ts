/**
 * Archive disk identity: the `.nebulisarchive` marker.
 *
 * This is what makes a destination "sticky". The same physical disk plugged in
 * at a different mount point is still our archive, and a *different* disk
 * plugged in at the same mount point is not. Both directions matter:
 *
 *  - Without the first, moving a disk would orphan every archived file.
 *  - Without the second, retention would eventually prune whatever happened to
 *    be mounted at the configured path, which is the external archive feature's
 *    highest-ranked risk.
 *
 * Modelled on `libraryPath.ts`'s library marker, with one deliberate difference.
 * That parser returns `null` for both "absent" and "invalid", which is enough for
 * its boolean `isLibraryAvailable()` check. Here the states have to be
 * distinguishable, because they call for different responses:
 *
 *   absent     set up a new archive
 *   match      proceed
 *   foreign    offer to adopt it, naming what was found
 *   invalid    refuse, and tell the user the marker is not one we recognise
 *   unreadable refuse; something is wrong with the file itself
 *
 * Collapsing `invalid` into `absent` would be the dangerous one: a disk holding
 * an unrecognisable marker would look empty, and the next run would write over
 * whatever an earlier or newer version of Nebulis had put there.
 *
 * Reads are side-effect free by construction. Nothing in this module creates,
 * repairs, or replaces a marker except `writeArchiveMarker`, which callers invoke
 * only after an explicit decision (adoption). `archiveMarker.test.ts` asserts
 * that reading leaves a foreign or invalid marker byte-identical.
