/**
 * Proof, during a run, that the archive disk is still the disk the run started on.
 *
 * The readiness check (`ensureArchiveDestinationReady`) answers that question once, before a run. A run
 * lasts minutes to hours, and a disk can be pulled, a share can drop, a host mount can go stale at any
 * point in it. On macOS and Windows the mount point usually disappears with the disk, so the next write
 * fails. On Linux and in Docker it does not: the mount point is an ordinary folder that outlives the mount,
 * so writing into it works, and the run carried on for every remaining file, filling the app's own disk
 * with a stray, unmarked "archive" that the disk would hide when plugged back in, and then reported success.
 *
 * Two rules stop that, and both live here so no write path can forget them:
 *
 *   1. **The archive root is never created by a run.** It must already exist. Only folders below it are
 *      made (`mkdirBelowRoot`). A missing root is a disconnected disk, not something to build.
 *   2. **The disk is re-proven around every write** (`assertPresent`): the root still exists, still sits on
 *      the same device it started on (a mount change flips the device id, even when the marker looks right),
 *      and still carries this install's marker.
 *
 * Restore does not use this. It writes into the library, whose own availability checks are separate.
