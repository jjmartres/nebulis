/**
 * Path containment and destination refusal for the external-archive feature.
 *
 * This module deliberately contains no I/O beyond `realpath` lookups: it is the
 * guard that every later step calls before it writes or deletes anything, and it
 * exists before any of that code does. The ordering is the point. This codebase
 * has lost user data twice by adding the capability before the guard:
 *
 *  - Four audit criticals came from one unchecked fallback (`getFolderName`
 *    returning the raw object id on a DB miss) reaching filesystem sinks that
 *    joined it onto the library root. `DELETE /library/objects/%2e` resolved to
 *    the library root and removed it recursively.
 *  - The Dwarf RESTACKED migration inferred "already present" from a path
 *    relationship rather than verifying a copy, then deleted the source. See
 *    `server/lib/library/archiveFolders.ts` → `migrateRestackedToSharedRootOnce`.
 *
 * So the archive destination is validated by construction, not by convention:
 *
 *  1. It can never be, contain, or be contained by the library or DATA_DIR. The
 *     archive feature's retention pass deletes files under its configured root,
 *     so a destination that overlapped the library would eventually prune the
 *     library it exists to protect. That is the single highest-ranked risk of the
 *     external archive feature.
 *  2. Every path built inside it is a strict descendant, checked lexically AND
 *     after resolving symlinks, so a link placed inside the archive root cannot
 *     redirect a write or a prune outside it.
 *
 * `resolveContainedObjectDir` in `server/lib/library/objects.ts` is the sibling
 * guard on the library side and the model for the lexical checks here.
