/**
 * The `appSettings` columns behind the archive feature, and the guarded
 * migration that adds them to an existing database.
 *
 * This lives in its own module, with no imports beyond a type, for two reasons.
 *
 * **No import cycle.** `db.ts` calls `ensureArchiveColumns` during its own boot,
 * and `archiveConfig.ts` reads the settings table through `db.ts`. If the column
 * definitions lived in `archiveConfig.ts`, `db.ts` would import a module that
 * imports `db.ts`. `libraryMaintenance.ts` exists in the same shape for the same
 * reason.
 *
 * **Testable migration.** The other `appSettings` columns are migrated by inline
 * statements in `db.ts`, which run once at import and cannot be exercised.
 * `archiveMarker`-style tests need to run the migration against a database that
 * genuinely lacks the columns, so it is a function over a database handle here.
 * `db.ts` calls it at the point the inline statements would have been.
 *
 * Adding a column here is a two-place change: this list, and the
 * `CREATE TABLE appSettings` block in `db.ts`. The test asserts that every column
 * in this list is NOT NULL with a default, so no read can ever yield `undefined`.
