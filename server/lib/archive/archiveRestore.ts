/**
 * Bringing archived files back into the library.
 *
 * The mirror of `archiveLocalRemoval`, and the second of the two write paths the
 * contract ranked as risks. Restore writes *into* `getLibraryDir()`, so it inherits
 * the containment discipline the four audit criticals were about, plus two of its
 * own:
 *
 *   - **It never overwrites differing local content silently.** A file that is
 *     already there and matches is left alone, which is what makes restore
 *     idempotent. A file that is already there and *differs* is reported as a
 *     conflict and skipped unless the caller confirmed overwriting for the whole
 *     call. The user's local edit is never the thing that loses by default.
 *   - **It never writes through something that is not a regular file.** A symlink
 *     in the target's place would send the write wherever it points, outside the
 *     library. That is refused outright, with or without confirmation.
 *
 * Writes go through `copyFileVerified`, the same function the copy engine uses, so a
 * restore is written to a `.part` name and verified before it takes its final one:
 * an interrupted restore cannot leave a half-written file wearing a real name.
 *
 * Restore never modifies the archive. There is no code path here that unlinks or
 * writes anything under the archive root.
