/**
 * The archive schedule.
 *
 * Three modes, evaluated on a one-minute tick, all in the observer's local time.
 * Four details are load-bearing, and the first two are copied from
 * `plannerNightlyPrefetch` because it already paid for them.
 *
 * **Daily and interval catch up; they are not a window.** That scheduler originally
 * fired inside a `±1 minute` window and therefore silently skipped the whole batch
 * for the day whenever the process was asleep, throttled, or GC-paused across those
 * two minutes — a laptop lid, a container. "Has it run since the target time today"
 * runs as soon as the process is awake, which for a nightly job is the behaviour
 * anyone would expect. The interval mode gets the same treatment for free by
 * measuring elapsed time rather than waiting for a slot.
 *
 * The daily catch-up is bounded by the local day, which is the one case worth knowing
 * about: a run missed at 23:30 on Monday is due again at 23:30 on Tuesday rather than
 * the moment the process wakes on Tuesday morning. Catching up across midnight would
 * mean a run window that is not a day, and a schedule that can fire twice within a few
 * hours of itself. The interval mode is the one to use for "as soon as possible after
 * N hours".
 *
 * **Custom does not catch up.** A cron expression names minutes, and there is no
 * honest way to decide that a run missed at 03:00 should happen at 09:15. It fires
 * when its minute comes round, which is what a cron expression means everywhere else.
 * Saying so in the settings summary is the price of supporting the mode at all.
 *
 * **A tick during a run is skipped, not queued.** The copy yields between files so
 * the API stays responsive, which is also what makes an overlapping tick possible.
 * A queued tick would immediately copy the whole library a second time.
 *
 * **The last-run instant is read from `archiveLastRunAt` rather than held in
 * memory**, so restarting the process does not re-run a job that already happened.
 * It is stamped *after* the attempt, so a process that died mid-run retries, while a
 * run that completed and failed does not get retried every sixty seconds against a
 * disk that is already unhappy. The user still has "run now" for that.
 *
 * **A refusal backs off; it does not retry every minute.** A full disk or an unplugged
 * drive is still full or unplugged a minute later, and each attempt walks the library
 * and wakes a sleeping disk. After a refusal from a scheduled tick the next attempt
 * waits `REFUSAL_BACKOFF_MS`, and the reason is written to `archiveLastResult` so the
 * Settings page shows why nothing happened. "Run now" ignores the backoff. The due
 * check comes first, so an archive that is not due never touches the destination.
 *
 * Nothing here runs while another library job is in progress: a migration copies
 * the library, and an import writes to it, and neither should be interleaved with
 * a run that is reading it.
