/**
 * Network share (UNC/SMB) access for the archive destination.
 *
 * A sibling to `server/lib/libraryNetwork.ts`, and deliberately a separate module
 * for the same reason that one is separate from the telescope SMB code: an archive
 * bug must not be able to regress the library's share, and the two can point at
 * different servers at the same time. They also need different mount points, since
 * one fixed mount directory cannot hold two shares.
 *
 * Platform support is identical to the library's, and for the same reasons:
 *
 *   - Windows: the destination is the UNC path itself (`\\host\share\sub`), and
 *     `net use` authenticates the session for a password-protected share.
 *   - macOS: the app runs as a per-user LaunchAgent, so it can mount into a session
 *     with `/Volumes` access. The share is mounted to a fixed directory under
 *     `DATA_DIR` rather than a temp directory, so the resolved path survives a
 *     restart.
 *   - Linux/Docker: not supported. A share is mounted at the host level and the
 *     mounted folder is configured as a local destination instead.
 *
 * **The resolved root is inside `DATA_DIR` on macOS, and that is the whole hazard.**
 * When the share is not mounted, the mount directory is an ordinary empty folder, so
 * "does the root exist" is true and the marker reads as absent. Anything that treats
 * that as an unadopted archive would write a marker into a local folder and then
 * copy the library onto the app's own disk. `isArchiveShareMounted()` and the
 * readiness check built on it exist for that; nothing in this module may be used to
 * conclude the destination is usable without them.
