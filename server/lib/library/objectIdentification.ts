/**
 * Identify the catalog object a folder name refers to.
 *
 * The folder-import wizard used to resolve a folder to an object with one
 * rule: `normalizeCatalogId(folderName)` had to be a catalog id on its own.
 * That works for a telescope's own folders ("M 42", "NGC 7000") but not for a
 * library the user has organised themselves, which is exactly what the "Files
 * already on the computer" option is for. Folder names like
 * "M42 - Orion Nebula", "M42_2024-01-15", "Seestar_M42", "Orion Nebula" or
 * "Bodes Galaxy" all fell through and became library objects named after the
 * folder, which is the complaint this module fixes.
 *
 * Deliberately conservative. Every rule below has to produce the *whole*
 * object on its own, and an ambiguous name (two different designations, e.g.
 * "M81_M82") resolves to nothing rather than guessing one of them. A miss is
 * cheap: the review screen lets the user search the catalog by hand. A wrong
 * match silently merges two of their objects, which is not recoverable by
 * clicking.
 *
 * Pure: catalog lookups only, no filesystem and no database, so the scan, the
 * commit fallback and a unit test all get the same answer.
