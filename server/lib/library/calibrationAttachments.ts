/**
 * Links flat/flat-dark calibration bundles (calibrationScan.ts) to the
 * library object/session they were captured for.
 *
 * On a cooled camera, bias and darks are stable across sessions (same gain/
 * exposure/temperature → the same dark current and read noise months later),
 * so the Calibration Library treats them as a shared, reusable pool — that is
 * the whole point of organizing them by settings rather than by session.
 * Flats (and their matching flat-darks) are the opposite: they correct for
 * the optical train's state *at capture time* — dust motes, focus position,
 * camera/filter-wheel rotation — which drifts session to session, so a flat
 * set is really only valid for the session(s) it was shot for. Most rigs
 * shoot a fresh set at the end of each session specifically because of this.
 *
 * This module is a pointer table, not a copy: attaching a bundle does not
 * move or duplicate any bytes, it only records "this bundle belongs to this
 * object/session" so it can be found again later (and, eventually, bundled
 * alongside that session's lights for reprocessing). Deliberately kept out of
 * calibrationScan.ts itself, which stays a pure filesystem read with no
 * database — this is the one place in the calibration feature that needs one.
