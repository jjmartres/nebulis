/**
 * Automatic refresh for linked folders.
 *
 * A source linked as "ongoing" carries `refreshIntervalMin`. Every tick this looks for sources whose
 * interval has elapsed and rescans them with the same `rescanSource` the Rescan button uses, so a
 * scheduled refresh and a manual one can never disagree about what a rescan does. A one-time source
 * (interval NULL) is never touched here.
 *
 * The rescan itself is synchronous, so sources run one after another with a turn of the event loop
 * between them, and nothing runs while any other library work (a copy import, an archive run, a
 * repair) holds the shared library lock.
