/**
 * Dwarf Videos folder: pure helpers shared by the live-sync path
 * (dwarfWalker.ts / import.ts), mirroring dwarfStartrails.ts.
 *
 * A Dwarf's Videos/ folder holds timelapse/short-clip captures that are not
 * observations of any celestial target — each clip is identified only by
 * when it was taken, same as a STARTRAILS capture. The live-sync path folds
 * every video into one shared synthetic library object ("DWARF Videos")
 * instead of inventing an object per clip, reusing the entire existing
 * object/session pipeline: this module only supplies the constants and the
 * one-time metadata patch that pipeline can't derive on its own.
