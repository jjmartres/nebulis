 * Calibration-frame folder recognition and filename metadata.

 * `objectDiscovery.ts` already excluded ASIAIR's flat `Dark/`, `Flat/`,
 * `Bias/` folders (singular, no target) from object discovery, and
 * `archiveFolders.ts`/`import.ts` already archive Dwarf's `CALI_FRAME`/
 * `DWARF_DARK` unconditionally. Neither recognized the shape a lot of real
 * calibration libraries actually take: plural folder names (`Darks`, `Flats`,
 * `Bias`), a "flat dark" frame type ASIAIR/N.I.N.A. users commonly shoot but
 * which had no folder-name mapping at all, and per-setup subfolders (one per
 * gain/exposure/binning/temperature combination, e.g. `G100_TECm8`,
 * `G100_60s_TECm8`) nested a level below the frame-type folder.
 *
 * A folder-import wizard run pointed at that shape today either drops the
 * plural folders on the floor entirely (not recognized as non-observation,
 * so `isObjectFolder` accepts them — they'd import as bogus objects named
 * "Darks" whose "sessions" are per-camera-setting subfolders) or, for the
 * singular ASIAIR names, only archives them when "archive everything" is on.
 * Both are wrong for data the whole point of this module is to give a real
 * home to. See archiveFolders.ts's file-level comment for the "promoted into
 * a real calibration-frame feature later" note this is that migration.
 *
 * Kept separate from objectDiscovery.ts (which owns folder-exclusion rules in
 * general) because this module also owns the filename metadata parse, which
 * objectDiscovery.ts has no reason to know about.
