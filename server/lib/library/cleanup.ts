/**
 * Library cleanup: how much space the removable extras take, and purging them.
 *
 * Only files the app itself copied into the managed library count. A row with a
 * `sourceId` belongs to a linked folder that still lives where the user keeps
 * it, and Nebulis never deletes from those (see the librarySources comment in
 * db.ts), so they are neither measured nor purged here.
 *
 * The libraryFiles table is a record of what was imported, not proof the file is
 * still there (the folder can be emptied or moved outside the app). Sizes count
 * only rows whose file exists on disk; rows whose file is gone are reported as
 * `staleRecords` and dropped by the purge. Callers must first confirm the library
 * is reachable, otherwise an unmounted drive would make every row look stale.
