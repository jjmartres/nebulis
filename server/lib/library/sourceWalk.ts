/**
 * Linked-library folders — the I/O layer that feeds `treeAttribution.ts`.
 *
 * Walks an arbitrary directory the server can read (a user's own, possibly
 * huge, hand-organised archive) and produces a flat list of real, importable
 * files as posix-style paths relative to the walk root. Bounded and defensive:
 * this runs against trees this codebase has never controlled the shape of.
 *
 * Deliberately does not know about the managed library, `DATA_DIR`, or any
 * database. Refusing to link a root that overlaps either of those is the
 * orchestration layer's job (`librarySources.ts`), not this generic walker's.
