/**
 * `npm run dev` starts Vite and the Express server side by side, and Express takes a few seconds to
 * boot (migrations, backfills). `tsx watch` also restarts it on every server edit. Any request that
 * lands in that gap used to log a full "http proxy error" stack trace, once per request, and hand the
 * browser an empty 502, so a tab that polls (telescope status) filled the terminal.
 *
 * A refused connection just means the API is not up yet. Answer it with a 503 + Retry-After, which
 * the client already retries, and log a single line per outage instead. Every other proxy error
 * (timeouts, resets on a live server) still goes through Vite's own handler untouched.
 *
 * Vite attaches its handler after `configure` runs, so it cannot be replaced from here; the
 * `emit` wrapper below is what keeps a refused connection from reaching it.
